# moodboards-sketch-plugin
The Moodboard Plugin is pretty self-descriptive: it creates moodboards! Just type in the topic you want to be inspired on, and get a whole world of images for your moodboard. Click the images that catch your eye â€“ and voila! You have yourself a pretty moodboard. Happy designing!
